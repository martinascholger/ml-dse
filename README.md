# Machine Learning for Digital Scholarly Editions, WS 2024/25
by Sarah Lang & Martina Scholger

This is the repository for the course "Machine Learning for Digital Scholarly Editions" at the University of Graz, winter semester 2024/25.
It will contain all Jupyter Notebooks and example data that we will use during the course.

## Usage

To use the notebooks make sure you have installed:
* Python version 3. 
* Jupyter. Install it via pip or conda (`pip install --user jupyter` or `conda install jupyter` if you use Conda/Anaconda)
* I suggest to also install jupyterlab, which is a more modern version of `jupyter notebook` (which was installed automatically with `jupyter`): 
  `pip install --user jupyterlab` or `conda install jupyterlab`.

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martinascholger/ml-dse.git
```

Then change into `ml-dse` directory and start the Jupyter server:

```bash
cd ml-dse
```

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or, if you have installed jupyterlab:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```

This will bring up your browser and will show you the contents of the `ml-dse` directory.
